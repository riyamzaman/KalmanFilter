# KalmanFilter
2D Kalman Filter Implementation

A python implementation of processing a given set of data using a 2D Kalman filter. The python program takes four arguments: the data file name, x-hat_(1,0), x-hat_(2,0), and a value lambda that will be used to compute P_0. Additionally, a plot is generated to plot the observed values against the predicted values.
